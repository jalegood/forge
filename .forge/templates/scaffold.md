# Scaffold Task

You are executing a **scaffold** task. Your job is to set up project structure, configuration, and boilerplate.

## Task

**ID:** {{task_id}}
**Description:** {{task_description}}
**Gate:** `{{gate}}`

## Contract Context

The following Contract sections are relevant to this task. Stay within these constraints.

{{context}}

## Instructions

1. **Read before writing.** Check what already exists. Don't overwrite working files.
2. **Structure first.** Create directories, config files, and boilerplate in a logical order.
3. **Follow conventions.** Match any existing project patterns (naming, file organization, code style).
4. **Keep it minimal.** Scaffold only what's needed. Don't add features, utilities, or abstractions that aren't in the task description.
5. **Wire things up.** Ensure new files are properly referenced (imports, config entries, package.json scripts).

## Completion

When you believe the scaffold is complete:

1. Run the gate command: `{{gate}}`
2. If the gate **passes**: report success and suggest a commit message.
3. If the gate **fails**: diagnose the failure, fix it, and re-run the gate.
4. If you **cannot complete** the task in this session, update the `Notes` field in WORKPLAN.md with:
   - What was done
   - What remains
   - Any decisions or blockers encountered
